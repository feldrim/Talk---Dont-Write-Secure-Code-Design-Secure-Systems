This contains sample code for my "Don't Write Secure Code - Build Secure Systems" talk.

The point of this code is to demonstrate the concepts, not to serve as reference code for
an implementation. I've generally taken tons of shortcuts and focused on code that easily
fits on my slides.

Copy the ideas and the core stuff, but add your own error handling / DI / refactoring / etc.
